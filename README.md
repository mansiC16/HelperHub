# HelperHub

## Project Description
HelperHub is a full-stack web platform that connects informal sector workers (like helpers, service providers, and laborers) with employers in real-time. It allows job seekers to create profiles, showcase skills, and receive requests, while employers can browse providers, send service requests, and manage profiles. The app focuses on house services, short-term jobs, and business helpers, with features for secure authentication and real-time matching.

This project was built as part of my IT Engineering studies at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT), Pune, to demonstrate skills in web development, database management, and user authentication.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up/login as job seeker or employer using email/password.
- **Profile Management**: Create and edit profiles with details like name, bio, skills, experience, and profile images.
- **Service Matching**: Browse providers by category (e.g., Maid, Babysitter, Cook) and send/receive requests.
- **Real-time Requests**: View sent/received requests with status (pending, etc.).
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Mock reviews and star ratings for providers (can be extended to real data).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly UI for better accessibility.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS (with components for pages like Home, Landing, Profile, and Service Providers).
- **Backend/Database**: Firebase (for authentication, real-time database, and storage).
- **Other Tools**: React Router for navigation, Firebase Storage for images, React Icons for UI elements, Vite for build tooling.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14+)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A Firebase project (set up Authentication, Realtime Database, and Storage)

  ## Screenshots
  Below are screenshots of the app's key outputs, showing how it looks and functions when running. These demonstrate the UI and user flow.
